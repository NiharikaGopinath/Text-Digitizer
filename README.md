# Model

To classify writers, I worked on a multi layer CNN in Keras, followed by an RNN in Tensorflow.  The problem of handwritten scribes, which are typically given by doctors and nurses is addressed here.Â Handwritten scripts are converted into digital records which can be stored in non-relational databases. The data for the model was taken from the IAM Handwriting database. This model is based on 657 distinct writers' handwriting. Multiple paragraphs were created by each writer, and sentences were extracted from those paragraphs.

# Results

Model's performance has been calculated based on a test set which has writings from among 50 writers. The model was not exposed to this data during training and validation Classification accuracy on Test Set : 94.1%
